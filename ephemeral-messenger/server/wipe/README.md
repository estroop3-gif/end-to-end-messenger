# Wipe Framework for Ephemeral Messenger

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY CRITICAL MODULE ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY SECURITY AUDIT REQUIRED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**

This module implements the wipe framework for the hardware key enforcement system. It provides policy-based data wiping when hardware keys are absent or other security conditions are met.

## üö® Safety Warning

**THIS MODULE PERFORMS DESTRUCTIVE OPERATIONS**

- Can permanently delete files and data
- Multiple authorization layers required
- Extensive safety mechanisms implemented
- Default configuration is test-mode only
- Emergency stop mechanisms included
- All operations are logged and auditable

## üìã Components

### 1. Policy Engine (`policy.go`)
- Defines wipe policies with cryptographic signatures
- Validates policy safety and risk levels
- Supports multiple authorization requirements
- Implements emergency override mechanisms

### 2. Execution Engine (`executor.go`)
- Executes wipe operations with safety checks
- Supports dry-run and test modes
- Implements secure file wiping techniques
- Provides emergency stop capabilities
- Maintains detailed audit logs

### 3. Monitoring System (`monitor.go`)
- Monitors hardware key presence
- Tracks system conditions and triggers
- Evaluates policy conditions
- Manages grace periods and confirmations
- Provides system health monitoring

## üîí Security Features

### Authorization Requirements
- **Cryptographic Signatures**: All policies must be Ed25519 signed
- **Multiple Authorizations**: High-risk operations require multiple signatures
- **Emergency Override**: Separate emergency override key system
- **Policy Validation**: Comprehensive policy validation with risk assessment

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Test Mode**: Default test mode prevents actual destructive operations
- **Dry Run Mode**: Simulation mode for testing without destruction
- **Confirmation Required**: User confirmation required for destructive operations
- **Emergency Stop**: Global emergency stop for all wipe operations
- **Safety Locks**: Filesystem locks prevent concurrent operations

### Risk Assessment
- **Automatic Risk Scoring**: Policies are automatically scored (low/medium/high/critical)
- **Path Validation**: Dangerous system paths are blocked
- **Size Limits**: Maximum operation size limits
- **Exclusion Lists**: System files and paths are excluded

### Audit and Monitoring
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All operations logged with timestamps
- **Operation Tracking**: Detailed tracking of files, bytes, and errors
- **Trigger History**: History of all trigger events and decisions
- **System Health**: Monitoring of system conditions

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Constraints

### Default Safety Configuration
```go
// Default safety settings
dryRunMode = true           // No actual deletion
testMode = true             // Test mode only
confirmationRequired = true // User confirmation required
emergencyStopEnabled = true // Emergency stop enabled
maxOperationSize = 1GB      // Size limit
```

### Permanently Blocked Operations
- **System Wipe**: `WipeActionSystem` is permanently disabled
- **Root Directory**: `/`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/etc` are never wipeable
- **Running Processes**: Files in use by running processes are protected
- **Large Recursive**: Large recursive operations require explicit authorization

### Trigger Conditions
- **Grace Periods**: Configurable grace periods before action
- **Activity Timeouts**: User inactivity requirements
- **Authentication Failures**: Failed authentication thresholds
- **Network Requirements**: Network connectivity requirements
- **Battery Levels**: Minimum battery level requirements

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Safe Policy Creation
```go
// Create a safe alert-only policy
policy := &WipePolicy{
    Version:     1,
    PolicyID:    uuid.New().String(),
    Name:        "Hardware Key Alert",
    Description: "Alert when hardware key is absent",
    Action:      WipeActionAlert,  // Safe action
    Trigger: WipeTrigger{
        KeyAbsentDuration: 5 * time.Minute,
        GracePeriodExpired: true,
    },
    TestMode: true,  // Safety mode
    DryRun:   true,  // Simulation only
}
```

### Monitor Integration
```go
// Initialize components with safety defaults
policyManager := NewWipePolicyManager()
executor := NewWipeExecutor()
monitor := NewWipeMonitor(policyManager, executor)

// Configure for maximum safety
monitor.SetConfiguration(
    30*time.Second,  // Check interval
    10*time.Minute,  // Grace period
    30*time.Minute,  // Activity timeout
    3,               // Max failed auth
    true,            // Test mode
    true,            // Require confirmation
)

// Add alert callback
monitor.AddAlertCallback(func(alertType, message, severity string) {
    log.Printf("WIPE ALERT [%s]: %s (%s)", alertType, message, severity)
})
```

### Policy Validation
```go
// Validate policy before loading
validation := policyManager.ValidatePolicy(policy)
if !validation.Valid {
    return fmt.Errorf("Policy validation failed: %v", validation.Errors)
}

if validation.RiskLevel == "critical" {
    return fmt.Errorf("Critical risk policies require additional review")
}
```
